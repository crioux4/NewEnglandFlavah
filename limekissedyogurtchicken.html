    <h2>Cooking Notes & Tips</h2>
    <p>I discovered this recipe when I accidently bought a large tub of plain greek yogurt thinking it was vanilla. 
        Prior to that I never cooked chicken with yogurt, and boy was I missing out! I altered the recipe I found online
        because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. If you have fresh limes on hand I suggest using them,
        Also adding the lime zest adds to the flavor. Origanally the recipe asked for fresh lemon juice, all I hand
        was bottled lime juice. I loved the flavor of the lime with the optional cayenne pepper. Oh my goodness
        this chicken was so good the first time only after 4 hours marinating, but I definitly suggest you try it overnight! 
        These are also awesome preppared as kabobs and cooked on the grill!
